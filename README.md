## Dataset

Our dataset is provided by the city of New York from the NYC OpenData in Excel format (OpenData). The record contained information about each 3-1-1 service request in New York City. The original dataset contains information from the year of 2010 until present with 27.1 million records and 41 columns. We will focus on the pandemic years and only extract records starting from the year of 2020.
